# WiFly_communicator Library for Arduino

This library is forked from the dev branche of https://github.com/Seeed-Shield/WiFi_Shield

The examples in this library are made for a WiFly connected to the Hardware TX/RX from an Arduino Leonardo (Serial1). 
The benefit of Arduino Leonardo that it separates the hardware port and the normal port for debugging with the Serial monitor (Serial). 

This library is also tested with the Helios Gadget (http://www.heliosgadget.nl/)

Included examples:
+ update firmware to 4.0
+ setup WiFi AP
+ test
